My code style consists of the following guidelines, make sure you always follow them, even in your examples:
- Braces on the same line with a single space, as such: 
	public void MyFunc() {

	}
- If the code block is short and you can omit the braces outright (one-line for, small if, etc.), do it. Example:
	for (int i = 0; i < myMemberVariable; ++i)
		Debug.Log($"i: {i}");
- As shown above, always put a space after keywords like for and if.
- Add breathing space (extra spaces) in the code, readability is paramount.
- Avoid functions over 50 lines if possible.
- Avoid static classes unless necessary.
