# Project Overview

A mobile game where the user is exploring and fighting through a procedurally generated network of rooms carefully generated by a voronoi graph and a grammar system to refine / generate things.

It will likely be a roguelike game where every run makes you get stronger... but the enemies will also get stronger (better ai, better strats... not just more numbers)

It should be in a 2.5D perspective, looking down at an angle to see rooms including the top of their edges and all. You may find a reference picture here in this folder under the name of "Perspective Reference.jpg".
